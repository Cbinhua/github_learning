Key Points
  (1)Create and use a repository;
  (2)Start and manage a new branch;
  (3)Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits;
  (4)Open and merge a pull request;
  
  
  Step 1. Create a Repository
      ①In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click  and then select New repository.
      ②Name your repository hello-world
      ③Write a short description.
      ④Select Initialize this repository with a README.
  Step 2. Create a branch（Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.）
      When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, 
      of master as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the
      master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.
  Step 3. Make and commit changes
      ①Click the README.md file.
      ②Click the  pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.
      ③In the editor, write a bit about yourself.
      ④Write a commit message that describes your changes.
      ⑤Click Commit changes button.
  Step 4. Open a Pull Request
